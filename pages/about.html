  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    After working in IT support in hospitals and providing consulting services,
    I spent 10 years in a hospital environment. Four of those years were as a
    manager, where I developed a strong foundation in healthcare operations.
    Seeking new challenges and driven by my long-time passion for programming, I
    decided to transition into system development, using my expertise in
    Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and healthcare integration to bring
    innovative solutions to the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    My experience in healthcare plays a significant role in my work today.
    Having spent years supporting and even implementing hospital management
    systems, I understand the challenges faced by healthcare teams using these
    systems. I also have a strong grasp of hospital IT infrastructure, business
    rules across various hospital departments, and an in-depth understanding of
    the EMR system itself, including its database structure and functionalities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Making the transition to programming has been challenging, especially since
    my formal education didn’t involve much hands-on programming time. The rapid
    evolution of tools and frameworks over the years has made it a challenge to
    catch up and stay current with the latest technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    What drives me most about systems integration is the potential to create
    solutions that genuinely benefit healthcare professionals, making their
    workflows easier and more efficient. By providing valuable integrations, I
    aim to improve service delivery and add real value to healthcare
    organizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m focused on achieving tangible outcomes through my work in development
    and integration, with a goal of reducing costs, minimizing repetitive tasks,
    and allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care.
    Additionally, I strive to improve the quality and speed of information flow,
    ensuring more accurate metrics for decision-making.
