      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        After working in IT support in hospitals and providing consulting
        services, I spent 10 years in a hospital environment. Four of those
        years were as a manager, but after being laid off, I had to take a new
        direction. I've always dreamed of programming, and my deep knowledge of
        Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in the healthcare sector led me to
        pursue programming and system integrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in healthcare plays a significant role in my work today.
        Having spent years supporting and even implementing hospital management
        systems, I understand the challenges faced by healthcare teams using
        these systems. I also have a strong grasp of hospital IT infrastructure,
        business rules across various hospital departments, and an in-depth
        understanding of the EMR system itself, including its database structure
        and functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making the transition to programming has been challenging, especially
        since my formal education didn’t involve much hands-on programming time.
        The rapid evolution of tools and frameworks over the years has made it a
        challenge to catch up and stay current with the latest technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drives me most about systems integration is the potential to create
        solutions that genuinely benefit healthcare professionals, making their
        workflows easier and more efficient. By providing valuable integrations,
        I aim to improve service delivery and add real value to healthcare
        organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m focused on achieving tangible outcomes through my work in
        development and integration, with a goal of reducing costs, minimizing
        repetitive tasks, and allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on
        patient care. Additionally, I strive to improve the quality and speed of
        information flow, ensuring more accurate metrics for decision-making.
